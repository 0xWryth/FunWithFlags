## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purpose.

### Prerequisites

Things you need to install the project :

- [MATLAB](https://mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)

### Running

Here are some instructions on how to get the development env running.

First, clone this repository with the following command :

	$ git clone https://github.com/adepreis/FunWithFlags

Then, after setting the MATLAB current path to the `/FunWithFlags` directory just created, execute the program using :

	> matlab.exe [-nodesktop -minimize -wait -log -r] ...

<!--
**If you are not familiar with MATLAB**, the most recent [release](https://github.com/adepreis/FunWithFlags/releases) includes the corresponding `.m` files for Octave.
